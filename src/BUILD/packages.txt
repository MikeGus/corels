In addition to creating the distribution here, we have created multiple
packages for easy installation:

1. Homebrew

The files live in this repository:
https://github.com/margoseltzer/homebrew-corels

The package gets installed here:
https://github.com/margoseltzer/corels-homebrew/files/1441466/corels-1.0.tar.gz
(If a new upload changes this location, you need to update a file in the homebrew repository, which you'll need to update with a new sha256 anyway.)

2. Arch linux

The package file is here:
https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=corels

Updating the package requires changing the source and sha256sums in that file.
